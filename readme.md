Overview
This project is dedicated to designing and deploying a robust cloud-based database system utilizing Microsoft Azure, demonstrating practical proficiency and innovative strategies in cloud engineering.  The project unfolds through a series of structured phases, each one addressing key components and processes essential to the architecture and implementation of a Azure cloud database solution. 

Milestone 1: Setting Up the Environment
Task 1:  Set up Github
		             GitHub used to track changes to code and save them online in a   
		             GitHub repo.   
		             https://github.com/Kayman2/azure-database-migration654
       
Task 2: Request Azure Credentials setup account
	               Make a support request for Azure account to use different    
	               services running on Azure throughout the project.


		
Milestone 2: Setting Up a Production Environment

Task1: Virtual Machine Creation 
Created a Windows Virtual Machine  (VM) named vm-kola-migration-svr (production-vm). Assigned the VM to the resource group named    rg-migration-db. 

Task2: Network Configuration 
Configured appropriate network  settings to ensure secure communication. Enabled RDP protocol for  secure remote connections. 

Task3: Remote Connection 
Initiated a  remote connection to the VM using Microsoft Remote Desktop and the  RDP protocol. 

Task4: SQL Server and SSMS Installation 
Installed SQL  Server on the VM to serve as the database server. Installed SQL  Server Management Studio (SSMS) for effective database management.   

Task5: AdventureWorks Database Restoration 
Obtained a backup file of  the AdventureWorks database. Restored the AdventureWorks database on  the production server. The AdventureWorks database serves as a sample  database, emulating a fictional manufacturing company's operations.
